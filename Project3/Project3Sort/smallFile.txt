Welcome to c++

This lab demonstrates how to create an efficient algorithm that will 
effectively sort the following words in order of most letters and 
also sort in alphabetical order. To do this I will spend a lot of time each 
day developing algorithms to solve this problem.

This is a short text file that will be used to test 
my algorithm and speed in order to complete the project.

I was born on June 2, 1995 in Houston, Texas.  I went to highschool at 
Dripping Springs and played Baseball and Basketball. 

The other text files will consist of a lot more words. Again this is just 
a sample small size to test my program. So yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.
